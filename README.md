# PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory (C++/CUDA)

PSCF is a package of software for field-theoretic simulation of
inhomogeneous equilibrium states of polymer liquids, with a focus
on microstructures formed by block polymers.  PSCF can perform both 
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations and some types of 
stochastic field-theoretic simulations (FTS) simulations. 

PSCF was originally designed for SCFT calculations, and provides an 
extensive set of tools for this.  The acronym PSCF stands for Polymer 
Self Consistent Field, reflecting this origin of the package.

The current version of PSCF (v1.2) is the first to also provide the
ability to perform field theoretic Monte-Carlo and Brownian dynamics 
simulations. The types of FTS provided by the current code are all
based on a partial-saddle point approximation to the exact 
"fully fluctuating" formation of the partititon function of a polymer
liquid as a functional integral. The exact fully-fluctuating formulation 
of polymer field theory (which is not implemented in this version of 
PSCF) requires the stochastic sampling of complex-valued fields. The 
partial-saddle point approximation used here is an approximation for 
incompressible models in which the Lagrange multiplier field that 
imposes a constraint on the total monomer density in the corresponding
fully-fluctuating theory is approximated at a mean-field or saddle-point
level, while other fields that couple to composition fluctuations are 
allowed to fluctuate. The resulting approximation allows the use of 
simulation algorithms that only involve real-valued fields, and that
share many key algorithms with SCFT, making it possible to create 
programs that implement both types of calculation.

The current version of PSCF is written primarily in C++, supplemented 
by CUDA code to enable the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU). 

## History

This C++/CUDA version of PSCF is intended to supersede an older Fortran 
SCFT program of the same name. The Fortran PSCF program is maintained 
in a separate github.com repository at https://github.com/dmorse/pscf.
The current C++/CUDA version provides almost all of the capabilities of
the older Fortran program, and several important new capabilities, as
discussed below.

Differences between the current C++/CUDA version of PSCF and the legacy
Fortran version include:

   - The current version is an extensible package of several different 
     programs designed for use with different types of spatial domain,
     different algorithms or different hardware, implemented within a 
     common framework.

   - The current version enables simulations of mixtures containing 
     both linear and acyclic branched block polymers, while the Fortran 
     PSCF program allowed only linear polymers.

   - The current version enables use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) 
     to dramatically accelerate some applications.

   - Starting with this release (v1.2), the current version of PSCF
     can perform some types of stochastic field-theoretic simulation 
     (FTS) in addition to SCFT.

## Programs

PSCF currently contains three programs:

   - **pscf_1d** : The program pscf_1d is is designed to performed SCFT
     calculations on one-dimensional (1d) problems in Cartesian, 
     cylindrical or spherical coordinates. A finite difference method is 
     used to solve the underlying partial differential equation, known 
     as the modified diffusion equation (MDE). This program is useful 
     for treating problems involving flat and curved interfaces, as well 
     as cylindrical or spherical copolymer micelles.  
     
   - **pscf_pc** : The pscf_pc rogram is designed to treat structures
     that are periodic in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, using conventional 
     CPU hardware. A pseudo-spectral algorithm is used to solve the
     MDE. This program provides capabilities for SCFT calculations 
     analogous to those of the older PSCF Fortran program, as well as 
     code for FTMC simulations. The suffix "pc" stands for 
     "periodic CPU".  
     
   - **pscf_pg** : The pscf_pg program is a GPU-accelerated version
     of pscf_pc that can also perform SCFT and FTMC simulations of
     periodic systems. It is based on algorithms similar to those 
     used in pscf_pc and provides almost identical features, but 
     provides much higher performance for large systems. The suffix 
     "pg" stands for "periodic GPU". 

FTMC simulations are only available in the two codes designed for use
with periodic boundary conditions (pscf_pc and pscf_pg). 

## Features

All PSCF programs are designed to treat an incompressible mixture 
containing any number of block polymers, homopolymers and small molecule 
(point-like) solvent molecular species. All polymeric species are 
treated using the standard Gaussian model of each polymer block as a 
continuous random walk.

Features that are common to all three PSCF programs, all of which apply 
to both SCFT and FTMC calculations, include:

  - Ability to treat mixtures of any number of block polymers and
    solvent species.

  - Ability to treat complex acyclic branched block polymers, in addition 
    to linear block polymers. Homopolymers are treated as a special case
    in which all blocks are chemically similar.

  - Ability to use canonical, grand-canonical or mixed statistical 
    ensembles - users may specify either a volume fraction or a chemical
    potential for each molecular species

  - Examples of input files for many types of calculation and structures

  - Python tools for data analysis

  - Thorough user and developer documentation provided as an integrated
    web manual

  - Well documented open source code written in object oriented C++

Features used in SCFT calculations that are common to all three PSCF 
programs include:

  - Efficient Anderson-mixing iteration algorithms

  - Efficient SCFT calculations for sequences of parameter choices along 
    a path in parameter space ("sweeps"), using extrapolation to 
    construct initial guesses

Features specific to the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for periodic systems 
include:

  - Ability to perform both SCFT and FTS calculations

  - Accurate pseudo-spectral solution of the modified diffusion equation

  - Ordered phases with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional periodicity

  - Unit cells with all possible 2D and 3D Bravais lattice systems (e.g., 
    cubic, orthorhombic, monoclinic, etc.)

  - Automatic optimization of unit parameters in SCFT so as to minimize 
    free energy density

  - Imposition of any user-selected space-group symmetry in SCFT

  - Built-in database of symmetry operations for all 230 3D space groups 
    and 17 2D plane groups for use in SCFT

  - Availability of a companion package 
    [Polymer Visual](<https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual/>)
    for visualization of periodic structures

Features specific to SCFT calculations performed with the pscf_pc CPU 
program are:

  - Inhomogeneous density constraints (a "mask")

  - External fields

  - Thin polymer films

The mask and external field features are used in pscf_pc to implement 
simulations of thin films - A mask is used to constrain a polymer 
material to a slit within a periodic supercell, and localized external 
fields are used to represent selective interactions with the top and 
bottom surfaces.

## Getting the source code

The current PSCF source code is maintained in the github repository

   <https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp>.

The source code may be obtained by using a git version control system
client to clone the repository. To do so on a machine with a git client,
enter the command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp.git
```
Note the use of the --recursive option to the git clone command. This
option is necessary to clone several git submodules that are maintained 
in separate repositories. This command will create a new directory 
called pscfpp/ that contains all of the source code and associated
documentation, including all required git submodules.

We do *not* recommend that users obtain the source code by simply
downloading a zip or tar file of a tagged release from the PSCF github 
repository, because this file will not contain source code for the other 
git repositories that are automatically downloaded and installed as 
submodules by the above git command. It is possible to install the
required submodules after the fact, but simpler to follow the 
instructions given above. 

## Documentation

PSCF is distributed with source files for an html web manual. A copy of 
the manual for the most recent numbered release is available online at

  <https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man>

After cloning the source code, users can also use the 
[doxygen](<https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>) documentation generation 
program to generate a local copy of the web manual.  To do this, the 
doxygen application must be installed on your computer, and the directory 
containing the doxygen executable must be in your unix command search 
PATH. To generate documentation:

   - Change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/ root directory

   - Enter "make html"

This should create many html files in the docs/html subdirectory of the 
pscfpp/ root directory.  To begin reading the resulting documentation, 
point a web browser at the file pscfpp/docs/html/index.html .  This is 
the main page of the web manual.

## Dependencies

PSCF has been developed on both linux and and Mac OS X operating systems,
and is designed to run on these or other unix-like systems.

The pscf_1d and pscf_pc CPU programs depend on the following external 
libraries:

  - [GSL](<https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>) - GNU Scientific Library

  - [FFTW](<https://www.fftw.org/>) Fast Fourier Transform library

The pscf_1d one-dimensional program pscf_1d requires only GSL, while
pscf_pc program relies on both GSL and FFTW.

The GPU-accelerated pscf_pg program can only be compiled and run on a 
computer with an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and an NVIDIA CUDA development kit.

Procedures for installing these dependencies are different for different 
operating system environments and different package managers. Instructions 
for some common environments are given in the web manual.

## Compiling

The PSCF source code is written using C++ as the primary language, with
CUDA used in pscf_pg for GPU acceleration. PSCF is only provided in 
source file format, and must be compiled from source.

The build system used to compile and install PSCF relies on standard unix 
utilities that are available in any unix-like command-line environment. 
To compile and run this or any other unix software on Mac OS X, the user 
should first install the Mac OS X unix command line tools. 

Complete directions for compiling and installing PSCF are provided in
section 2 of the [web manual](<https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man>).
A brief summary is given below of instructions for steps that must be 
taken after cloning the git repository and installing all of the 
required dependencies:

   - Add the directory path pscfpp/bin to your unix command search PATH
     environment variable. This is where executables will be installed.

   - Add the directory path pscfpp/lib/python to your PYTHONPATH 
     environment variable. This is necessary to allow a python interpreter 
     to find python modules that are used by the build system. 

   - Run the pscfpp/configure script by entering "./configure" from the 
     pscfpp/ root directory, with or without an optional filename argument. 
     This script installs default versions of several files that are 
     required by the build system. The configure script usually only 
     needs to be run once, before compiling for the first time.  In a 
     linux environment, it is usually sufficient to run the configure
     script without a filename argument.  See Section 2.6 of the 
     [web manual](<https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man>) for more 
     information about how to invoke the configure script for Apple OS X.

   - To compile and install only CPU-based programs in the package on a
     computer that does not have an appropriate NVIDA GPU, simply enter
     "make" from the pscfpp/ root directory immediately after 
     running the configure script. 

   - Some further configuration is required to compile all PSCF programs,
     including GPU-enabled programs, on a machine that has an appropriate 
     NVIDA GPU and a CUDA development kit. To do so, first enter 
     "./setopts -c1" from the pscfpp/ directory to enable compilation of 
     CUDA code. Then use the -a option of the same setopts script to set 
     the correct GPU architecture for your system. For example, to 
     compile for a V100 GPU with CUDA compute capability 7.0, one would 
     enter "./setopts -a sm_70". Instructions for choosing the correct 
     string parameter for the -a option for a particular GPU can be obtained 
     by entering "./setopts -h" or by consulting the installation section 
     of the web manual.  After these steps, enter "make all" to compile. 

The "make" command installs all resulting executable files in the 
pscfpp/bin directory. 

The procedure described above for building PSCF is similar to the standard 
"configure; make; make install" procedure for GNU software, except that 
it does not require a separate "make install" command. This is because 
the PSCF "make" command is designed to create executables in the the 
pscfpp/bin directory, and the above instructions assume that this is 
their intended final destination.  If the pscfpp/ directory is installed 
within a user's home directory, the above instructions do not require 
the use of sudo or adminstrator permission, but instead require the user 
to modify their PATH variable to allow the unix shell to find executables 
installed in psfpp/bin.

## Command line usage

PSCF is a package containing three different SCFT programs (pscf_1d,
pscf_pc, and pscf_pg) that are designed for different geometries or
different hardware, but that have very similar interfaces. To perform a
calculation, each of these programs must read a parameter file and a 
command file. The parameter file, which is processed first, is a fixed
format file that contains parameters required to describe the physical 
system of interest and initialize the program before performing any 
computation. The command file is a script that contains a sequence of 
commands that are read and executed in the order that they appear.  
Contents and syntax for PSCF parameter and commands files are discussed 
in Sec. 3 of the web manual. 

The command file usually contains the names of several input and output 
data files as arguments to commands that read or write these files. 
Specifically, a command file to perform either a SCFT or FTS calculation 
normally contains a command to read an input file that contains an 
initial guess for the monomer chemical potential fields.  A command 
file for an SCFT calculation normally also contains commands that write 
converged chemical potential and monomer concentration fields to output
files. 

The usual command line syntax for invoking the pscf_1d program for 
one-dimensional SCFT calculations is
```
pscf_1d -p param -c command -e
```
where "param" denotes the name of a parameter file, and "command" denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -p and -c options are required.

The "-e" command line option in the above example is not required, but 
causes the program to "echo" the parameter file to standard output as 
this file is being processed. Use of this option makes it easier to 
debug any failure arising from a syntax error in the parameter file. 

The command line interface for the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs requires 
a value for the spatial dimension of the structure as an additional 
parameter.  This is an integer with a value 1, 2 or 3, that specifies 
the number of coordinates along which the structure is periodic, which
must be provided as the parameter of the -d option. The usual syntax for 
invoking pscf_pc for a three dimensionally periodic structure (e.g., a 
network structure or an arrangement of spheres), while also using the 
-e  option, is thus
```
pscf_pc -d 3 -p param -c command -e
```
The syntax for a simulation of one-dimensionally periodic lamellar phase 
would instead use 1 as the argument of the -d option. The syntax for 
invoking pscf_pg is the same as that for pccf_pc, except for the use 
of the different program name.

Programs that are invoked as shown in the above examples would write log 
output that is produced during execution to the user's screen (i.e., to 
standard output).  This log output may instead be redirected to a file 
by using the unix ">" standard output redirection operator. For example, 
a command such as 
```
pscf_pc -d 3 -p param -c command -e > log
```
would redirect log output that is written during simulation of a 
3-dimensionally periodic structure to a file named "log" in the current 
working directory. Standard output should normally be redirected to a 
file when a program is run in a queue on a shared resource.

## Examples

The quickest way to learn the syntax of the PSCF parameter and command
files is by examining examples.  The directory pscfpp/examples contains 
examples of input files for many different types of SCFT calculations.  
Top level subdirectories of the examples/ directory contain examples 
for different PSCF programs (pscf_1d, pscf_pc, or pscf_pg). 

Subdirectory examples/1d contains examples of SCFT calculations for the 
1D finite-difference program pscf_1d. Top level subdirectories of the
directory examples/fd contain examples for planar, cylindrical and 
spherical geometries, as indicated by the subdirectory names. One or
more example is given for each geometry.

Subdirectory examples/pc contains examples for the pscf_pc CPU program. 
Top level subdirectories of examples/pc named scf/ and fts/ contain
examples of SCFT and FTS calculations, respectively. Top level 
subdirectories of examples/pc/scf contain examples of input files for
SCFT calculations performed on different types of physical system.
For example, the directory examples/pc/scf/diblock contains examples 
for a diblock copolymer melt.  Subdirectories of examples/pc/scf/diblock 
contain examples for lamellar, hexagonal, and BCC structures, among 
others.

Subdirectory examples/pg contains examples for the pscf_pg program for 
periodic structures. Subdirectories are organized in a manner similar 
to that used for the examples/pc directory tree.

We refer to a directory that contains all of the input files for a single 
example or a set of very closely related examples as an example directory.  
Each such example directory contains at least one parameter file (usually 
named "param"), at least one command file (usually named "command"), and 
an input chemical potential field (w field) file. Example directories 
that contain input files for two or more examples usually contain a single
file that contains an initial guess for the chemical potential field, but 
may contain different parameter or command files for use in different 
examples.

Example directories that contain files for a single example usually
contain a shell script named "run" that can be executed to run the 
example using the supplied input files.  The simplest way to run such an 
example is thus to change directory (cd) to the relevant example directory 
and enter "./run" from within that directory. (Note the use of the 
prefix "./", which tells the operating system to look for the run script 
in the current working directory).  Users may also inspect the text of 
such a run script to see the command and command line options used to 
run the example.  Example directories that contain input files for two 
or more closely related examples may contain several such scripts with 
names that are variants of "run", each of which can be execute to run a 
specific example. 

Almost every example directory also contains a script named "clean" 
that can be executed to remove all of the output files that are created 
by running the example.
