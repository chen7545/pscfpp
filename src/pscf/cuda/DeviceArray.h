   /**
   * Dynamic array on the GPU device with aligned data.
   *
   * This class wraps an aligned C array with elements of type Data that
   * is allocated in GPU device global memory.  All member functions may
   * be called from the CPU host, but this class does not offer access
   * to individual elements via the subscript operator, operator[].
   *
   * A DeviceArray can be in any of three states:
   *
   *   (1) Unallocated: In this state, there is no associated memory,
   *   so capacity() returns zero, while isAllocated(), isOwner() and
   *   isAssociated() return false. 
   * 
   *   (2) Data owner: In this case, this object owns a block of memory that
   *   it is responsible for allocating and de-allocating. In this state, 
   *   capacity returns a positive value, isAllocated() and isOwner() 
   *   return true, and isAssociated() returns false.
   *
   *   (3) Data user: In this case, this object wraps a C array via
   *   a pointer to data that is owned by a different container. We
   *   described this by saying this DeviceArray is a data user that
   *   is "associated" with memory owned by another container that is 
   *   the data owner.  In this state, capacity() returns a positive 
   *   value, isAllocated() and isAssociated() return true, and 
   *   isOwner() returns false. 
   *  
   * When a DeviceArray is a data user but not an owner (case 3), it 
   * is not responsible for allocation or deallocation of the underlying 
   * C array, and merely acts as a reference to the section of data owned 
   * by another container.  Memory that is owned by a DeviceArray may be 
   * allocated and deallocated by calling the allocate and deallocate 
   * member functions.  Memory owned by a DeviceArray is also dellocated 
   * when the DeviceArray is destroyed. 
   *
   * A DeviceArray<Data> object may be associated as a data user with:
   *
   *   - A slice of an array of Data objects owned by another 
   *     DeviceArray<Data>, or
   *
   *   - A block of bare memory owned by a DeviceMemory container
   *
   * Associations with either type of data owner can be created and 
   * destroyed by calling the associate and dissociate member functions 
   * of the data user. Attempts to create an association cause an
   * Exception to be thrown if the requested slice of shared data 
   * would exceed the bounds of the block owned by the data owner.
   *
   * A DeviceArray<Data> that serves as an owner of data that is used
   * by one or more other associated DeviceArray<Data> objects maintains
   * a count of how many associated objects refer to its data. This
   * counter is incremented when an association is created by a user
   * and decremented when the user destroys the association.
   *
   * When a DeviceArray<Data> object is destroyed, any data that it
   * owns is automatically deallocated, and any associations with 
   * external data are destroyed. 
   *
   * It is an error to deallocate memory owned by a DeviceArray or 
   * DeviceMemory container that is still referred to by one or more 
   * associated DeviceArray data users. Doing so is illegal because it
   * creates dangling pointers. Attempts to prematurely deallocate 
   * such a shared memory block are detected by the owner, and cause an 
   * Exception to be thrown if it occurs with a deallocate function,
   * or cause an error message to be written to a log file if the 
   * error occurs during destruction of the data owner.  Programmers 
   * must thus take care to ensure that all DeviceArray objects that 
   * act as date users associated with a block of shared memory either 
   * explicitly delete the association (by calling the dissociate 
   * member function) or are destroyed before the container that owns 
   * the shared memory deallocates the memory or is destroyed.
