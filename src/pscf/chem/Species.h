   * must be provided as a parameter in the parameter file, thereby also
   * determining the choice of ensemble.  A subclass of Species that 
   * actually solves the single single-molecule statistical mechanics 
   * problem must use the function setQ(double) to set set the value 
   * of the molecular partition function q and to compute a new value 
   * for either mu or phi, depending on the ensemble.
