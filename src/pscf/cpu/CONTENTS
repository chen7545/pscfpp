This src/pscf/cpu directory contains utility functions and classes that 
are analogous to other defined in the src/pscf/cuda directory, but that 
use different hardware: All code defined in this directory is written in
standard C++ and uses standard CPU hardware, whereas analogous code in 
the pscf/cuda directory uses C++/CUDA code to perform some computations 
in parallel on a GPU. All functions defined here that take standard CPU
arrays as parameters, defined as instantiations of Util::Cuda<Data>, are 
analogous to corresponding functions defined in pscf/cuda that instead 
take Pscf::DeviceArray<Data> parameters, for which data resides in global 
GPU memory. Classes and functions with analogous interfaces defined in
these two directories are intended to be used interchangeably in function 
templates that are used to create pairs of closely analogous programs 
(e.g., pscf_rpc and pscf_rpg) that use CPU vs. GPU hardware.
