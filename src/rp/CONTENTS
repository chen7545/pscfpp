This directory contains a set of class templates that are defined in 
namespace Rp and are designed to be used in programs that implement
SCFT and PS-FTS calculations that use real fields and periodic boundary 
conditions. Each of these class templates is designed to be used as a 
base class for a corresponding pair of analogous classes with the same
name as the base class template that are defined in program-level 
namespaces Pscf::Rpc and Pscf::Rpg, which contain code for analogous 
programs that run on CPU or GPU hardware.  Use of templates as base 
classes that contain algorithms that are used in such pairs of closely 
analogous helps reduce code duplication in such classes.

The src/rp, src/rpc and src/rpg directories have analogous subdirectory 
structures.

Subdirectories:
