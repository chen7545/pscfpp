This directory contains C++/CUDA code used by a GPU-accelerated program 
pscf_rpg for self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and partial saddle-point
field theoretic simulation (PS-FTS) with real fields and periodic boundary 
conditions.  FTS algorithms implemented in this directory rely on a 
partial saddle point approximation (PS-FTS).  Code in this directory is 
generally very closely analogous to that in the src/rpc directory, which 
is used to construct the analogous pscf_pc CPU program.

All classes and functions defined in this directory are in namespace 
Pscf::Rpg.  The name Rpg stands for 'real periodic GPU'. Code in namespace
Rpg may use classes and functions defined in namespace Util (directory 
src/util), namespace Pscf::Prdc (directory src/prdc/), or namespace 
Pscf::Prdc::Cuda (directory src/prdc/cuda), as well as those defined
directly the parent namespace Pscf. Many header and source files in this
directory contain "using namespace" expressions that allow names from 
the Util, Pscf::Prdc and Pscf::Prdc::Cuda namespaces to be used without 
explicit namespace qualifiers.
