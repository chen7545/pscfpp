   * MDE solver for one direction of one block.

   * A fully initialized Propagator<D> has an associations with a Block<D>
   * object that owns this propagator and its partner, and with a partner
   * Propagator<D> that solves the MDE within the same block in the
   * opposite direction. It also has an association with a Mesh<D> that
   * describes a spatial grid, and associations with zero or more source
   * Propagator<D> objects that are used to compute an initial condition
   * for this propagator at the head vertex.
   *
   * The associated Block<D> stores information required to numerically
   * solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE), including quantities
   * that depend upon the w-field associated with this block, the unit
   * cell parameters and (in the thread model) the contour step size.
   * These quantities are set and stored by the block because their values
   * are the same for the two propagators owned by each block, but may be
   * different for different blocks.  The algorithm used by a Propagator
   * to solve the MDE repeatedly calls step functions provided by the
   * parent Block.
