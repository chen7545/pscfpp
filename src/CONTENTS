This src/ directory contains all C++ and CUDA C++ source code for the PSCF 
package.  The subdirectories util/, pscf/, prdc/, r1d/, rpc/, and rpg/ 
each contain source code for classes and functions defined in a particular 
C++ namespace.  Subdirectories util/ and test/ are maintained as separate 
github repositories that are installed as submodules of the pscfpp 
respository. 

Subdirectories (with corresponding C++ namespace names in parentheses):

  util - general utilities for scientific computation (Util)
  pscf - classes accessible throughout the PSCF package (Pscf)
  r1d  - real fields, one-dimensional SCFT (Pscf::R1d)
  prdc - periodic systems (Pscf::Prdc)
  rp   - SCFT & PS-FTS with real periodic fields, CPU & GPU (Pscf::Rp)
  rpc  - SCFT & PS-FTS with real periodic fields, CPU  (Pscf::Rpc)
  rpc  - SCFT & PS-FTS with real periodic fields, GPU  (Pscf::Rpc)
  cp   - CL-FTS with complex periodic fields, CPU & GPU (Pscf:Cp)
  cpc  - CL-FTS with complex periodic fields, CPU (Pscf:Cpc)
  cpg  - CL-FTS with complex periodic fields, GPU (Pscf:Cpg)
  test - unit testing framework (base classes)

  Directories r1d, rpc, rpg, cpc, and cpg are "program level" directories 
  that each contain code that is only accessible to and used by a single 
  executable program, namely, pscf_1d, pscf_pc, pscf_rpg, pscf_cpc, or
  pscf_cpg.

  Directories util, pscf, prdc, rp, and cp each contain code that is
  used in multiple programs. Names defined in files located in the util 
  and pscf directories are accessible anywhere in PSCF. Names defined 
  in the prdc directory are accessible in the other directories 
  containing code designed for periodic boundary conditions (rp, rpc, 
  rpg, cp, cpc, and cpg), but are not used in the r1d directory. Names 
  defined in the rp directory are used in the rpc and rpg program level 
  directories. Names defined in the cp directory are used in the cpc 
  and cpg program level directories

Files (maintained in the git repository):

  setopts  - script for managing compile-time options
  makefile - main makefile for in-source compilation (build in src)
  programs.mod - doxygen page for program command-line interfaces
  CONTENTS - this file

Files (initially installed by the configure script):

  config.mk - main configuration file (editable makefile fragment)
