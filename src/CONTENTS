This src/ directory contains all C++ and CUDA C++ source code for the PSCF 
package.  The subdirectories util/, pscf/, prdc/, r1d/, rpc/, and rpg/ 
each contain source code for classes and functions defined in a particular 
C++ namespace.  Subdirectories util/ and test/ are maintained as separate 
github repositories that are installed as submodules of the pscfpp 
respository. 

Subdirectories (with corresponding C++ namespace names in parentheses):

  util - general utilities for scientific computation (Util)
  pscf - classes accessible throughout the PSCF package (Pscf)
  prdc - shared classes for periodic structures (Pscf::Prdc)
  r1d  - real fields, one-dimensional SCFT (Pscf::R1d)
  rpc  - real periodic fields, SCFT & PS-FTS on CPU (Pscf::Rpc)
  rpg  - real periodic fields, SCFT & PS-FTS on GPU (Pscf::Rpg)
  cpc  - complex periodic fields, CL-FTS on CPU (Pscf::Cpc)
  test - unit testing framework (base classes)

  Directories r1d, rpc, rpg, and cpc are "program level" directories 
  that each contain code that is only accessible to and used by a single 
  executable program, namely, pscf_1d, pscf_pc, pscf_rpg, or pscf_cpc.

  Directories util, pscf, and prdc each contain code that may be used in
  multiple programs. Names defined in files located in the util and pscf 
  directories are accessible anywhere in PSCF. Names defined in the prdc 
  directory are accessible in the rpc, rpg and cpc program-level
  directories, but not in the r1d directory.

Files (maintained in the git repository):

  setopts  - script for managing compile-time options
  makefile - main makefile for in-source compilation (build in src)
  programs.mod - doxygen page for program command-line interfaces
  CONTENTS - this file

Files (initially installed by the configure script):

  config.mk - main configuration file (editable makefile fragment)
