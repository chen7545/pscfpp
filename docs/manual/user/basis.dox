PSCF allows users to input and output chemical potential and monomer
concentration fields using an expansion in basis functions in which
each basis function is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian that is
invariant under all symmetry operations of a specified space group.
We refer to the resulting basis as a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis,
and the expansion as a symmetry-adapated Fourier series. This page
discusses the mathematics underlying the construction of such a basis.

Computations in the PSCF programs for periodic systems are performed
using periodic fields defined on a regular grid, with Fourier transforms
defined using a discrete Fourier transform. For simplicity, discussion
given here uses notation appropriate to functions that are defined in a
continuum.  Everything presented here applies equally well to functions
defined on a grid, however, with the understanding that values of such
functions are only defined for positions that lie on nodes of the grid,
and that wavevectors that are aliases of one another should be
understood to be equivalent.

\section user_basis_symmfunc_sec Transformation and Symmetry of Fields

<b> Definition (Field) </b>: We refer to any complex-valued periodic
function of D-dimensional position within a crystal as a <em> field </em>.
A real field has real values at any position.

<b> Notation (Transformation of Fields) </b>:
If \f$ f \f$ is a field and \f$ A \f$ is a space group operation, then
the notation
\f[
    f' = fA
\f]
indicates that \f$ f' \f$ is a field for which
\f[
  f'({\bf r}) = f(A(r))
\f]
for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$.

\anchor user_basis_symmfunc_def
<b> Definition (Symmetric Fields) </b>:
A field \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is said to be symmetric or invariant under
a space group \f$ S \f$ if \f$ fA = f \f$ or (equivalently)
\f[
   f(A({\bf r})) = f({\bf r})
\f]
for every space group operation \f$ A \in S \f$.

The following two simple theorems apply to symmetric functions:

\anchor user_basis_symmfunc_mult_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.1 (Symmetry is Preserved by Scalar Multiplication)</b>:
If \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is a field that is symmetric under a space group
\f$ S \f$, and \f$ c \f$ is complex constant, then \f$ cf({\bf r}) \f$
is also symmetric under \f$ S \f$.

\anchor user_basis_symmfunc_conj_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.2 (Symmetry is Preserved by Complex Conjugation)</b>:
If \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is a complex field that is symmetric under a
space group \f$ S \f$, its complex conjugate \f$ f^{*}({\bf r}) \f$
is also invariant under \f$ S \f$. This also implies that the real
and imaginary parts of a symmetric complex-valued function are also
symmetric under \f$ S \f$.

<em>Proofs</em> :
Suppose \f$ A = (R, {\bf t}) \f$ be a symmetry operation in \f$ S \f$.
If \f$ f(R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) = f({\bf r})\f$ for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$,
then \f$ c f(R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) = c f({\bf r}) \f$ and
     \f$ f^{*}(R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) = f^{*}({\bf r}) \f$,
proving both of the above theorems.


\section user_basis_wave_sec Transformation of Plane Waves

To construct basis functions, we consider the effect of space group
operations on a field that is expressed as a general Fourier series.
As a first step, it useful to consider the effect of a symmetry operation
on a single complex-exponential wave.
The following definition and notation are used to simplify the discussion:

<b> Definition (Wave) </b>:
A wave or plane wave \f$ f \f$ is a complex field of the form
\f[
   f({\bf r}) = ce^{i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf r}}
\f]
in which \f$ c \f$ is a constant prefactor and \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a
wavevector.  A wave has the periodicity of a specified Bravais lattice
if and only if \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is in the associated reciprocal lattice.

<b> Notation (Wave) </b>: A wave \f$ f \f$ can be described compactly as
a pair
\f[
   f = ({\bf G}, c)
\f]
in which \f$ {\bf G} \f$ denotes the associated wavevector and \f$ c \f$
is the prefactor.

<b> Theorem 2.3 (Transformation of Waves) </b>:
If \f$ f = ({\bf G}, c) \f$ is a wave and \f$ A=(R,{\bf t}) \f$ is a space
group operation, then \f$ fA \f$ is a wave
\f[
   fA = ({\bf G}', c')
\f]
with a modified wavevector
\f[
   {\bf G}' = R^{T}{\bf G}
\f]
and a modified prefactor
\f[
   c' =  c e^{i{\bf G} \cdot {\bf t}}  \quad.
\f]
Comment: Recall the \ref user_symmetry_adjoint_def_eqn "definition"
of the adjoint of a point group operator \f$ R \f$ and the
\ref user_symmetry_adjoint_matrix_sub "discussion" of the matrix
representation used to compute the effect of such an adjoint
operator on a wavevector.

<em> Proof </em>:
The field \f$ f(A({\bf r})) \f$ that is obtained by applying
operation \f$ A = (R, {\bf t}) \f$ to the argument \f$ {\bf r} \f$
of a field \f$ f({\bf r}) = c e^{i {\bf G}\cdot {\bf r}} \f$ is
\f[
   f(A({\bf r}))
   =  c e^{i{\bf G} \cdot (R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) }
   =  c e^ {i {\bf G}\cdot {\bf t} } e^{ i{\bf G} \cdot R{\bf r} }
   \quad.
\f]
By using the fact that
\f[
   {\bf G}\cdot (R{\bf r}) \equiv (R^{T}{\bf G})\cdot {\bf r}
\f]
we may rewrite this function as a plane wave
\f[
   f(A({\bf r}))
   =  c' e^{ i {\bf G}' \cdot {\bf r}}
\f]
with values of \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ and \f$ c' \f$ given in the theorem
statement.

It is straightforward to confirm that this transformation of waves is
invertible: If \f$ f' = fA \f$ then \f$ f = f'A^{-1} \f$.  Two waves
that are related in this way can be said to related by the symmetry
operation \f$ A \f$, or by \f$ A^{-1} \f$.

<b> Notation (Transformation of Wavevectors) </b>:
If \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a wavevector and \f$ A= (R, {\bf t}) \f$ is a
space group symmetry operation, then we define  \f$ {\bf G}A \f$ to
be the wavevector of a wave that is obtained by applying symmetry
operation \f$ A \f$ to a wave with wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$, giving
\f[
  {\bf G}A \equiv R^{T}{\bf G} \quad.
\f]
It is straightforward to show that, for two wavevectors \f$ {\bf G} \f$
and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ and a symmetry operation \f$ A \f$, the equations
\f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G}A \f$ and \f$ {\bf G} = {\bf G}'A^{-1} \f$ are
equivalent.
Two wavevectors that are related by in this way can said to be related
by symmetry operation \f$ A \f$ or \f$ A^{-1} \f$.

Observe that the notation defined above, which the operator appears
to the right of the wavevector on which it acts, allows use to treat
application of symmetry operators to wavevectors as an associative
operation.  That is, if
\f$ A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A} )\f$ and \f$ B=(R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B} ) \f$
are space group operations and \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a wavevector, then
\f[
   ({\bf G}A)B = R_{B}^{T}(R_{A}^{T}{\bf G}) = (R_{A}R_{B})^{T}{\bf G}
   = {\bf G}(AB) \quad,
\f]
where \f$ AB \f$ denotes a product of symmetry operations, defined such
that \f$ (AB)({\bf r}) = A(B({\bf r})) \f$ for any \f$ {\bf r} \f$.

\section user_basis_star_sec Wavevector Stars

The first step in the algorithm used by PSCF to construct symmetry
adapted basis functions is to partition the set of all of the distinct
reciprocal lattice vectors used in the Fourier expansion of periodic
functions on a lattice into non-intersecting subsets of wavevectors
that are related to one another by symmetry group operation. As already
noted, we refer to each such set of symmetry related wavevectors as a
star.

Two simple examples may help illustrate the idea:

   - In a 1D crystal with inversion symmetry (a centrosymmetric lamellar
     phase), any two nonzero, inequivalent wavevectors \f$ {\bf G} \f$
     and \f$ -{\bf G} \f$ are related by inversion symmetry and thus
     form a star containing these two wavevectors.

   - In a 3D cubic crystal, all of the wavevectors with Miller indices
     that are related to a particular set of non-negative integers
     \f$ \{hkl\} \f$ by changes in sign of one or more indices and/or
     permutations are related by symmetry elements of a cubic crystal.
     The number of wavevectors in such a star is always equal to or
     less than 48 if the integers i, j, and k are all nonzero and
     unequal, and is less than 48 if any of the integers h, k, and l
     are equal to zero or if any pair of these integers are equal.

Wavevectors in a star are always related by point group operations
associated with elements of the space group, as described above, and
are always vectors of equal magnitude.  More formal definitions are
given below.

<b> Definition (Closed Set of Wavevectors) </b>:
Suppose that \f$ T \f$ is a set of wavevectors and \f$ S \f$ is a
space group. Set \f$ T \f$ is closed under group \f$ S \f$ if, for
any wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \in T \f$ and any operation \f$ A \in S \f$,
then \f$ {\bf G}A \in T \f$.

<b> Definition (Star) </b>: A <em>star</em> is a set of reciprocal lattice
vectors associated with a space group \f$ S \f$. A star \f$ T \f$ of a
space group \f$ S \f$ is a set of reciprocal lattice vectors for which:

   - Closure: Set \f$ T \f$ is closed under \f$ S \f$.

   - Connectivity: If \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ are
     wavevectors in \f$ T \f$, then there exists a symmetry operation
     \f$ A \in S \f$ such that \f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G} A \f$.

Comment: If two wavevectors \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}'\f$ are
related by any sequence of symmetry operations in \f$ S \f$, then
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ are also related by a single
symmetry operation in \f$ S \f$ that is given by the product of
operations in that sequence. The requirement that any two wavevectors
in a star be related by a single symmetry operation is thus completely
equivalent to a requirement that they be related by some sequence of
space group symmetry operations.

\anchor user_basis_star_intersect_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.4 (Intersecting Stars are Equal) </b>:
If \f$ T \f$ and \f$ T' \f$ are both star functions of a space group
\f$ S \f$ with \f$ T \cap T' \neq \emptyset \f$, then \f$ T = T' \f$.

<em> Proof </em>: Suppose that \f$ T \cap T' \neq 0 \f$. Suppose that
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}'\f$ are wavevectors such that
\f$ {\bf G} \in T \cap T' \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \in T' \f$.  Because
both \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ are in \f$ T' \f$, there must
exist \f$ A \in S \f$ such that \f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G}A \f$.  Because
\f$ T \f$ is closed under \f$ S \f$, \f$ {\bf G}' \in T \f$.
This implies that that every vector in \f$ T' \f$ is also in \f$ T \f$,
or \f$ T' \subseteq T \f$. By reversing the roles of \f$ T \f$ and
\f$ T' \f$ reversed, by supposing that \f$ {\bf G} \in T \cap T' \f$
and \f$ {\bf G}' \in T \f$, we may show by analogous arguments that
\f$ T \subseteq T' \f$, implying that \f$ T = T' \f$.

\ref user_basis_star_intersect_thrm "Theorem 2.4" is logically equivalent
to the statement that unequal stars must have an empty intersection.
It also implies that a star cannot be proper subset of another star.

\anchor user_basis_star_generate_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.5 (Generating a Star from a Wavevector) </b>:
Suppose that \f$ {\bf G}_{0} \f$ is a reciprocal lattice wavevector,
\f$ S \f$ is a space group. Let \f$ Q \f$ denote the set of all
wavevectors that are related to \f$ {\bf G}_{0} \f$ by elements
of \f$ S \f$, such that each wavevector in \f$ Q \f$ is equal to
\f$ {\bf G}_{0}A \f$ for some operation \f$ A \in S \f$.
Set \f$ Q \f$ is a star of \f$ S \f$ that contains \f$ {\bf G}_{0} \f$.

<em> Proof </em>:
To prove that \f$ Q \f$ is a star, we must prove closure under
\f$ S \f$ and connectivity.

To prove closure, suppose \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a wavector in \f$ Q \f$
and \f$ A \f$ is an element of \f$ S \f$ for which
\f$ {\bf G} = {\bf G}_{0} A \f$.  Let \f$ B \f$ also be an element
of \f$ S \f$ and let \f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G}B  = {\bf G}_{0}(AB) \f$.
Because \f$ AB \f$ must be element of \f$ S \f$ (because a group
must be closed under multiplication), this implies that
\f$ {\bf G}' \in Q \f$ for any \f$ B \in S \f$, proving that
\f$ Q \f$ is closed under \f$ S \f$.

To prove connectivity, suppose \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G} '\f$
are wavevectors in \f$ Q \f$, for which there thus must exist space
group operations \f$ A \in S \f$ and \f$ B \in S \f$ such that
\f$ {\bf G} = {\bf G}_{0}A \f$ and
\f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G}_{0}B \f$.
Observe that \f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G}C \f$ where \f$ C = A^{-1}B \f$
is also in \f$ S \f$.

Because every space group must contain the identity element
\f$ E \f$, and \f$ {\bf G}_{0} = {\bf G}_{0}E \f$, set \f$ Q \f$
must contain \f$ {\bf G}_{0} \f$.

\anchor user_basis_star_unique_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.6 (Every Wavevector Belongs to a Unique Star) </b>:
If \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a reciprocal lattice wavevector and
\f$ S \f$ is a space group, then \f$ {\bf G} \f$ belongs to exactly
one star of \f$ S \f$.

<em> Proof </em>:
Let \f$ T \f$ denote the set that is generated by applying all the
elements of \f$ S \f$ to \f$ {\bf G} \f$.
By \ref user_basis_star_generate_thrm "theorem 2.5", \f$ T \f$ is a
star of \f$ S \f$ that contains \f${\bf G} \f$.
Suppose \f$ T' \f$ are both stars of \f$ S \f$ such that \f$ {\bf G}
\in T \f$ and \f$ T' \f$. This implies \f$ T \cap T' \neq \emptyset \f$
and thus, by \ref user_basis_star_intersect_thrm "theorem 2.4" , that
\f$ T = T' \f$.

\section user_basis_star_functions_sec Star Functions

A star function is a linear superposition of waves with wavevectors
in a star with coefficients chosen such that the superposition is
symmetric under the space group.

\anchor user_basis_starfunc_def
<b> Definition (Star Function) </b>:
Suppose \f$ T \f$ is a star of a space group \f$ S \f$ that contains
\f$ M \f$ wavevectors, such that
\f$ T = \{ {\bf G}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf G}_{M-1} \} \f$.
A <em>star function</em> associated with \f$ T \f$ is defined to be
a nonzero function \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ that is symmetric under
\f$ S \f$ and that is equal to a superposition
\anchor user_basis_starfunc_eqn
\f[
   \phi(\textbf{r}) =
   \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} c_{i} e^{i\textbf{G}_{i} \cdot \textbf{r}}
\f]
of waves with wavevectors in \f$ T \f$, with complex coefficients
\f$ c_{0}, \ldots, c_{M-1} \f$. The constant \f$ c_{i} \f$ in such
a sum is referred to as the coefficient associated wtih wavevector
\f$ {\bf G}_{i} \f$.

Some properties of star functions follow immediately from the their
definitions as superpositions of waves with wavevectors that belong
to a star.

<b> Theorem 2.7 (Star Functions are Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian )</b>:
Every star function \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ associated with a star \f$ T \f$
of a space group \f$ S \f$ satisfies an eigenfunction equation
\f[
   -\nabla^{2}\phi({\bf r} = \lambda\phi({\bf r})
\f]
in which the eigenvalue \f$\lambda\f$ is equal to the square magnitude
of any of wavevectors in star \f$ T \f$.

<em> Proof: </em> Each star function is a superposition of waves with
wavevectors that are related by unitary point group operations, and
are thus wavevectors of equal magnitude. Because these waves are all
thus eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with equal eigenvalues, any
superposition of these waves is also an eigenfunction of the Laplacian
with the same eigenvalue.

<b> Theorem 2.8 (Star Functions of Different Stars are Orthogonal ) </b>:
If \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ and \f$ \phi'({\bf r}) \f$ are star functions
associated with different stars of the same space group, then they are
orthogonal, in the sense that
\f[
    \int d^{D}r \; \phi^{*}({\bf r}) \phi'({\bf r}) = 0 \quad,
\f]
where the integral is taken over one unit cell of the lattice.

<em> Proof </em>: Orthogonality of star functions follows from the
fact that waves with different wavevectors are orthogonal in the same
sense, and that the intersection of different stars is an empty set.

The relationship among coefficients in this expansion of a star
function may be determined by requiring that the function be symmetric
under the specified space group.

\anchor user_basis_starfunc_phase_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.9 (Relationships Among Coefficients in a Star Function) </b>:
Suppose that \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is a star function associated with a
star \f$ T = \{ {\bf G}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf G}_{M-1} \} \f$ of space group
\f$ S \f$ that contains \f$ M \f$ wavevectors.
Suppose \f$ {\bf G}_{i} \f$  and \f$ {\bf G}_{j} \f$ are wavevectors in
\f$ T \f$ and that \f$ A = (R, {\bf t}) \f$ is a symmetry operation
in \f$ S \f$, for which
\f[
   {\bf G}_{j} = {\bf G}_{i}A \quad.
\f]
The coefficients for the waves associated with wavectors
\f$ {\bf G}_{i} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}_{j} \f$ must satisfy
\anchor user_basis_phase_eqn
\f[
   c_{j} = c_{i} e^{ i{\bf G}_{i}\cdot{\bf t} } \quad.
\f]
where \f$ c_{i} \f$ denotes the coefficient of the wave with wavevector
\f$ {\bf G}_{i} \f$ in the superposition of the form given in the above
\ref user_basis_starfunc_def "definition of a star function".

<em>Proof</em>: Suppose
Suppose that
\f[
   \phi(\textbf{r}) =
   \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_{i} e^{i\textbf{G}_{i} \cdot \textbf{r}}
\f]
is a star function associated with star \f$ T \f$ of a space group that
\f$ S \f$ that contains a symmetry element \f$ A = (R,{\bf t}) \f$.
The transformed star function \f$ \phi A \f$ can be expressed as a
superposition
\f[
   \phi(A({\bf r})) =
   \phi( R{\bf r} + {\bf t} ) = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} c_{i}
   e^{ i\textbf{G}_{i}R \cdot \textbf{r}}
   e^{i{\bf G} \cdot {\bf t}}
   \quad.
\f]
The equation relating \f$ c_{i} \f$ and \f$ c_{j} \f$ follows from the
requirement that coefficients of corresponding waves be equal in the
expansions of \f$ \phi \f$ and \f$ \phi A \f$.

<b> Corollary: </b> The relatiohships among coefficients obtained
in \ref user_basis_starfunc_phase_thrm "Theorem 2.9" imply that the
coefficients associated with different waves in a star function must
all have equal absolute magnitude,
\f[
    |c_{1}| = |c_{2}| = \cdots |c_{M}| \quad.
\f]

\anchor user_basis_phaserel_def
<b> Definition (Phase Relationships Between Wavevectors) </b>:
The equation relating the coefficients of two waves within a star given
in \ref user_basis_starfunc_phase_thrm "Theorem 2.9" is known as a phase
relationship between these waves, or between the associated wavevectors.
The quantity \f$ {\bf G}\cdot {\bf t} \f$ will be referred to as the
phase change generated by applying a symmetry operator
\f$ A = (R,{\bf t}) \f$ to wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$, and
\f$ e^{i{\bf G}\cdot {\bf t}} \f$ as the corresponding phasor.

<em> Additivity of Phase Changes </em>:
It is straightforward to confirm that the overall phase shift obtained
by applying several symmetry operations in sequence to an initial
wavevector is the same as that obtained by applying the corresponding
product of operations. Suppose \f$ {\bf G} \f$, \f$ {\bf G}' \f$
and \f$ {\bf G}''\f$ are related by symmetry operations \f$ A \f$ and
\f$ B \f$ such that
\f[
    {\bf G}' = {\bf G}A  \quad, \quad
    {\bf G}'' = {\bf G}'B = {\bf G}AB
\f]
where \f$ A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A}) \f$
and   \f$ B = (R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B}) \f$.
This implies that \f$ {\bf G}'' = {\bf G}C \f$, where
\f[
 C \equiv AB =  ( R_{A}R_{B}, {\bf t}_{A} + R_{A}{\bf t}_{B} ) \quad.
\f]
The phase change generated by applying \f$ C \f$ to \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is
given by a sum
\f[
  {\bf G}\cdot {\bf t}_{C}
  = {\bf G} \cdot ( {\bf t}_{A} + R_{A} {\bf t}_{B} )
  = {\bf G} \cdot {\bf t}_{A} + {\bf G}'\cdot {\bf t}_{B}
  \quad,
\f]
that is simply equal to the sum of
the phase change \f$ {\bf G}\cdot{\bf t}_{A} \f$ generated by applying
\f$ A \f$ to \f$ {\bf G} \f$ plus
the phase change \f$ {\bf G}'\cdot{\bf t}_{B} \f$ generated by applying
\f$ B \f$ to \f$ {\bf G}' \f$.

\subsection user_basis_cancel_sub Cancelled Stars

The set of phase relationships among waves in a star of \f$ M \f$
wavevectors is a homogeneous system of linear equations for the
coefficients \f$ c_{1}, \ldots, c_{M} \f$.  This system of equations
always has a trivial solution in which all of the coefficients are zero.
For some stars of some space groups, this trivial solution is the only
one.

<b> Definition (Cancelled Star) </b>: A star of a space group is said to
be <em>cancelled</em> if the only solution to the relationships among
the coefficients of waves in the star function is the trivial solution
\f[
   c_{1} = c_{2} = \cdots = c_{M} = 0
   \quad,
\f]
for which the coefficients of all waves are zero.

The stars of a space group that are cancelled are the same as the ones
for which systematic cancellations of scattering intensities are observed
in scattering experiments.  Nonzero star functions to not exist for
cancelled stars The Fourier series expansion of periodic functions with
a specified space group symmetry in a basis of star functions thus uses
only star functions that are associated with uncancelled stars (i.e.,
those that are not cancelled)

<em> Centered Lattices </em>:
The simplest reason for cancellation of stars in PSCF occurs in the
case of face- or body-centered lattices if one uses a conventional
Bravais lattice with orthogonal Bravais basis vectors that yield a
non-primitive conventional unit cell (e.g., simple cubic or tetragonal)
that contains two or more primitive unit cells. In these cases, the
associated space group must contain symmetry operations of the form
\f$(I, {\bf t})\f$ that simply translate the structure by a fraction
of a unit cell along each Bravais lattice direction. For example, a
a body-centered-cubic lattice can be described by a simple cubic
Bravais lattice and space group that includes a centering operation
\f$(I, {\bf t})\f$ with \f${\bf t} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)\f$. This sort of
description, which is used by default by PSCF, leads to cancellation
of stars of wavectors that belong to the reciprocal lattice of the
lattice with a non-primitive unit cell (e.g., simple cubic) but that
actually do not belong to the reciprocal lattice of the centered
lattice.  This particular type of cancellation causes trivial
contradictions in phase relationships for cancelled stars.

<b> Definition (Trivial Contradiction) </b>:
Suppose \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a wavevector in a star of space group \f$ S \f$
and \f$ A = (R, {\bf t} \f$ is a symmetry operation in \f$ S \f$ with
\f$ {\bf t} \neq 0 \f$ that maps \f$ {\bf G} \f$ onto itself, such that
\f[
    {\bf G} = {\bf G}A  \quad.
\f]
The existence of such a symmetry leads to a phase relationship
\f[
   c = e^{i{\bf G}\cdot {\bf t}} c \quad.
\f]
This is said to cause <em> trivial contradiction </em> for wavevector
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ if
\f[
   e^{i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf t}} \neq 1  \quad,
\f]
since in this case, the only solution to this phase relationship is the
trivial solution \f$ c = 0 \f$.

<b> Theorem 2.10: Trivial Contradictions Infect Entire Stars </b>:
If \f$ T \f$ is a star of space group \f$ S \f$ and a trivial
contradiction exists for any wavevector in \f$ T \f$, then a trivial
contradiction exists for every wavevector in \f$ T \f$.

<em> Proof </em>: Suppose that \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a wavevector
in \f$ T \f$ for which there exists a symmetry operation
\f$ A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A}) \f$ such that \f$ {\bf G}={\bf G}A \f$
and \f$ \exp ( i {\bf G} \cdot {\bf t}_{A} ) \neq 1 \f$, giving a
trivial contradiction for \f${\bf G}\f$.
Suppose that \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ is a different wavevector in \f$ T \f$,
for which there must exist an operation
\f$ B = ( R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B} ) \f$ in \f$ S \f$ such that
\f$ {\bf G} = {\bf G}'B^{-1} \f$. There thus exists a symmetry
\f$ C = B^{-1}AB \f$ such that \f${\bf G}' = {\bf G}' C \f$ that
can be shown to lead to a phase relationship
\f$ c' = c' e^{ i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf t}_{A} } \f$ for the coefficient
\f$ c' \f$ of the wave with wavevector \f$ {\bf G}' \f$. This
implies the existence of a trivial contradiction for any wavevector
\f$ {\bf G}' \in T \f$.

Cancellation of a star can also be demonstrated by demonstrating
that there exist pairs of wavevectors in the same star that are
related by two symmetry operation that generate contradictory phase
relationships. We refer to this as a binary contradiction.

<b> Definition (Binary Contradictions) </b>:
Suppose \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ are two different
wavevectors in a star of space group \f$ S \f$ that are related
by two different symmetry operations \f$ A, B \in S \f$, such that
\f[
   {\bf G}' = {\bf G}A = {\bf G}B  \quad,
\f]
where \f$ A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A}) \f$ and
\f$ B = (R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B}) \f$.
The phase relationships generated by these symmetry operations to
a wave with wavevector \f${\bf G}\f$ are said to yield a
<em>binary contradiction</em> if
The resulting phase relationship is said to be a
\f[
   e^{i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf t}_{A}} \neq e^{i{\bf G}\cdot {\bf t}_{B}}
   \quad.
\f]
The existence of one or more binary contradictions among the phase
relationships associated with a star implies that the star is
cancelled.

<b> Theorem 2.11 (Binary Contradictions Imply Trivial Contradictions) </b>:
If the phase relationships for the coefficients waves in a star function
contain one or more binary contradictions, then there also exists a trivial
contradiction for every wavevector in the associated star.

<em>Proof</em>:
Suppose that a star \f$ T \f$ of space group \f$ S \f$ contains two
distinct wavevectors \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ and that
\f$ S \f$ contains two distinct operations
\f$ A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A}) \f$ and
\f$ B = (R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B}) \f$
such that \f$ {\bf G}' = {\bf G}A = {\bf G} B \f$, and such that
\f$ e^{i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf t}_{A}} \neq e^{i{\bf G}\cdot {\bf t}_{B}} \f$,
leading to a binary contradiction.  Let \f$ C = AB^{-1} \f$ and observe
that \f$ {\bf G} = C{\bf G} \f$.
Applying \f$ C \f$ to a wave \f$ f({\bf r}) = c e^{i{\bf G}\cdot {\bf r}} \f$
generates a transformed wave
\f[
   f(A(B^{-1}({\bf r})) =
   c e^{i{\bf G}\cdot ({\bf t}_{A} - {\bf t}_{B})}
   e^{i{\bf G}\cdot {\bf r}}
   \quad,
\f]
with the same wavevector. Requiring  that
\f$ f(A(B^{-1}({\bf r}) = f({\bf r}) \f$
have equal prefactors within the expansion of a star function
generates a trivial inconsistency if and only if
\f[
  e^{i{\bf G} \cdot ({\bf t}_{A} - {\bf t}_{B})} \neq 1 \quad.
\f]
Observe that this is equivalent to the criterion for the existence
of a pairwise contradiction involving wavevectors \f$ {\bf G} \f$
and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$, completing the proof.

The algorithm used by PSCF to identify cancelled stars tests for
the existence of trivial contradictions involving the prefactors
of any wave.

\subsection user_basis_noncancel_sub Uncancelled Stars

\anchor user_basis_starfunc_uniqueness_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.12 (Uniqueness of Star Functions to Within Constant) </b>:
If two functions \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ and \f$ g({\bf r}) \f$ are both
nonzero star functions associated with a star \f$ T \f$ of space group
\f$ S \f$ (i.e., are both superpositions of waves with wavevectors in
\f$ T \f$ that are symmetric under \f$ S \f$ ), then
\f[
   g({\bf r}) = c f({\bf r})
\f]
for some constant \f$ c \f$.

<em> Proof </em>: Consider a star \f$ T \f$ with \f$ M \f$ wavevectors
\f$ {\bf G}_{1}, \ldots, {\bf G}_{M}  \f$. The set of complex functions
that can be expressed as superpositions of waves with wavevectors in
\f$ T \f$ is a vector space with dimension \f$ M \f$. Each function in
this space has a one-to-one correspondence with a list of values for
the \f$ M \f$ coefficients \f$ c_{1}, \ldots, c_{M} \f$ that appear in
the linear superposition of these waves. Because every pair of wavevectors
in a star are related by some symmetry operation in the relevant space
group, there exists a phase relationship involving the coefficients
associated with any two waves with different wavevevectors in the star.
If two symmetry operations relate a single pair of wavevectors, the
phase relationship obtained from these different symmetry operations
must be equivalent, or the set of equations will not have a nontrivial
solution.  Starting from any one wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$ in a star,
we can thus construct a set of \f$ M - 1 \f$ independent linear
equations given by the equations that relate the coefficient of the wave
with wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$ to the coefficients of the waves
associated with every other wavevector in the star. The set of solutions
of the resulting set of equations must thus be a vector space with
dimension 1 or less. If a nontrivial solution exists, the space of
solutions must also have dimension 1 or greater, because we know that
\f$ c f({\bf r}) \f$ is a solution if \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is a solution.
If any nontrivial solution exists, the space of solutions must thus be
a vector space of dimension one. This corresponds to a set of solutions
that can all be expressed as \f$ c f({\bf f}) \f$, in which \f$ c \f$
is a complex constant and \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is a single solution.

\section user_basis_closed_sec Closed Stars

<b> Definition (Closed Stars) </b>: A set of wavevectors \f$ T \f$
is <em>closed</em> under inversion if, for every wavevector
\f$ {\bf G} \in T \f$, \f$ -{\bf G} \in T\f$.

The following theorem simplifies the treatment of closed stars:

\anchor user_basis_closed_real_thrm
<b> Theorem 2.13 (Closed Stars Yield Real Star Functions) </b>:
If \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is a star function associated with a star
that is closed under inversion, then there exists a complex constant
\f$ c \f$ for which \f$ c \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is a real-valued function
of position \f$ {\bf r} \f$.

<em> Proof </em>: Suppose that \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is a nonzero
star function associated with a star \f$ T \f$, and is thus invariant
under the space group \f$ S \f$ used to define the star. Let
\f$ \phi({\bf r}) = u({\bf r}) + iv({\bf r}) \f$ where \f$ u \f$ and
\f$ v \f$ are real functions that represent real and imaginary parts.
If \f$ u({\bf r}) \neq 0 \f$ and \f$ v({\bf r}) = 0 \f$, then
\f$ \phi({\bf r} \f$ is real, and \f$ c \f$ can be any real number.
If \f$ u({\bf r}) = 0 \f$ and \f$ v({\bf r}) \neq 0 \f$, then
\f$ -i\phi({\bf r}) \f$ is real, and \f$ c \f$ can be any pure
imaginary number.
If \f$ u({\bf r}) \neq 0 \f$ and \f$ v({\bf r}) \neq 0\f$, then
\f$ u \f$ and \f$ v \f$ are two functions that are superpositions of
waves in star \f$ T \f$ and symmetric under space group \f$ S \f$.
Because the set of such functions is a vector space of dimension 1,
this implies that there exists a real constant \f$ d \f$ such that
\f$ v({\bf r}) = d u({\bf r}) \f$ for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$, giving
\f$ \phi({\bf r}) = (1+id)u({\bf r}) \f$. In this case
\f$ \phi({\bf r})/(1+id) \f$ is real, giving \f$ c \propto 1/(1+id)\f$.

\section user_basis_open_sec Open Stars

<b> Definition (Open Sets of Wavevectors) </b>: A set of wavevectors
\f$ T \f$ is <em>open</em> under inversion if, for every wavevector
\f$ {\bf G} \in T\f$, \f$ -{\bf G} \notin T \f$.

Note that this definition allows for the possibility that a set of
wavevectors can be neither open nor closed if the set contains one
subset of wavevectors for which the inverse is also in the star, and
another subset of wavevectors for which the inverse is not in the set.
It turns out, however, that this intermediate case is not possible
for a star of a space group.

<b> Theorem 2.14 (Stars Are Either Open or Closed) </b>:
Every star of a space group must be either open or closed.

<em> Proof </em>: First consider the special cases of stars with only
one or two wavevectors.  If a star \f$ T \f$ contains only one
wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$, then \f$ T \f$ is closed under inversion if
\f$ {\bf G} = 0 \f$ and open under inversion if \f$ {\bf G} \neq 0 \f$.
If a star \f$ T \f$ contains exactly two wavevectors,
\f$ T = \{ {\bf G}, {\bf G}' \} \f$, then both wavevectors must be
nonzero vectors of equal magnitude, and \f$ T \f$ is closed under
inversion of \f$ {\bf G}' = -{\bf G} \f$ and open otherwise. Now
consider the case of a star that contains three or more nonzero
wavevectors.  Suppose that a star \f$ T \f$ of space group \f$ S \f$
contains three or more nonzero wavectors, and that is not closed, so
that there exists at least one wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \in T \f$ for
which \f$ -{\bf G} \in T \f$.  Let \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ be any other
wavevector in \f$ T \f$, for which \f$ {\bf G}' \neq {\bf G} \f$ and
\f$ {\bf G}' \neq -{\bf G} \f$. There must exist a symmetry operation
\f$ A = (R, {\bf t}) \f$ in \f$ S \f$ such that
\f$ {\bf G}' = R^{T}{\bf G} \f$ .
Closure of the star under symmetry operations then implies that
\f$ - {\bf G}' \f$ is also in \f$ T \f$, because
\f$ -{\bf G}' = R_{A}^{T}(-{\bf G}) \f$. This implies that if such a
star is not open, it must be closed, completing the proof.

<b> Definition (Inverse of a Set of Wavevectors) </b>:
If \f$ T = \{ {\bf G}_{1}, \ldots , {\bf G}_{M} \} \f$ is a set of
wavevectors, then \f$ \{ -{\bf G}_{1}, \ldots , - {\bf G}_{M} \} \f$
is known as the inverse of \f$ T \f$. If a star is open, then it has
no intersection with its inverse. If a star is closed, it is equal
to its own inverse.

<b> Theorem 2.15 (The Inverse of an Open Star is a Star) </b>:
If \f$ T \f$ is an open star of wavevectors for space group \f$ S \f$,
then the inverse of \f$ T \f$ is also a star of \f$ S \f$.

<em> Proof </em>:
We first prove closure of the inverse of \f$ T \f$ under \f$ S \f$:
For each vector \f$ -{\bf G} \f$ in the inverse of \f$ T \f$ and each
space group operation \f$ A = (R, {\bf t}) \f$ in \f$ S \f$, the
vector \f$ (-{\bf G})A = -({\bf G}A) \f$ is also in the inverse of
\f$ T \f$, proving closure.

We next prove connectivity: Suppose \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf G}' \f$
are both nonzero wavevectors that belong an open star \f$ T \f$ of space
group \f$ S \f$, for which there must exist a symmetry operation
\f$ A = ( R, {\bf t}) \f$ in \f$ S \f$ such that
\f$ {\bf G}' = R^{T}{\bf G} \f$. This also implies that
\f$ -{\bf G}' = -{\bf G}A \f$, thus implying that any two vectors
\f$-{\bf G}\f$ and \f$-{\bf G}'\f$ in the inverse of \f$ T \f$ are
related by a space
group symmetry.

<b> Theorem 2.16 (Star Functions for Open Stars) </b>:
If \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is a star function of space group
\f$ S \f$ that is associated with an open star \f$ T \f$, then the
complex conjugate \f$ \phi^{*}({\bf r}) \f$ is a star function
associated with the inverse of \f$ T \f$.

<em> Proof </em>:
Suppose that \f$ T = \{ {\bf G}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf G}_{M-1} \} \f$
is a non-cancelled open star of space group \f$ S \f$ that contains
\f$ M \f$ wavevector.
Suppose that \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is an associated star function,
given by a superposition
\f[
   \phi({\bf r}) = \sum_{i=0}^{M} c_{i} e^{i{\bf G}_{i}\cdot{\bf r}}
   \quad.
\f]
The complex conjugate \f$ \phi^{*}({\bf r}) \f$ is given by a sum
\f[
   \phi^{*}({\bf r}) = \sum_{i=0}^{M} c_{i}^{-} e^{i{\bf G}_{i}\cdot{\bf r}}
   \quad,
\f]
which is a superposition of waves with wavevectors that belong to the
set \f$ \{ -{\bf G}_{0}, \ldots, -{\bf G}_{M-1} \} \f$, which is the
inverse of \f$ T \f$.
Because \f$ \phi({\bf r}) \f$ is invariant under group \f$ S \f$, by
theorem
so is \f$ \phi^{*}({\bf r})) \f$.
This implies that \f$ \phi^{*}({\bf r}) \f$ is a star function
associated with the inverse of set \f$ T \f$.

\section user_basis_centro_sec Centrosymmetric Groups

\anchor user_basis_centro_def
<b> Definition (Centrosymmetric Groups) </b>: A space group is
centro-symmetric if it contains an operation that represents inversion
through some inversion center. Inversion through an inversion center
located at position \f$ {\bf c} \f$ is explicitly by
\f[
   i = (-I, 2 {\bf c})
\f]
for which
\f[
   i({\bf r}) = -{\bf r} + 2{\bf c} \quad,
\f]
and for which \f$ i({\bf c}) = {\bf c} \f$.

The following theorem allows a particularly simple treatment of star
functions of centro-symmetric groups:

\anchor user_basis_centro_closed_thrm
<b> Thereom 2.9 </b>: All stars of a centro-symmetric group are closed
under inversion.

<em>Proof</em>: An inversion operation \f$ i = (-I, 2{\bf c}) \f$
with inversion center \f$ {\bf c} \f$ transforms every wavevector
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ in a star into its inverse
\f[
  {\bf G}i = -I{\bf G} = -{\bf G} \quad,
\f]
where we have used the fact that \f$ (-I)^{T} = -I \f$.
This implies that, for any centrosymmetric group, if a wavevector
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ is in a star, then \f$ -{\bf G} \f$ is in the same
star, and thus that every star must be closed under inversion.

By \ref user_basis_closed_real_thrm "Theorem 2.9", this implies
that, a real star function can be defined for every star of any
centro-symmetric group,

\section user_basis_fourier_sec Symmetry-Adapted Fourier Series: General

PSCF creates a sequence of star functions, denoted here by
\f$ \phi_{0}({\bf r}, \phi_{1}({\bf r}), \phi_{2}({\bf r}), \ldots \f$,
that form an orthonormal basis for functions that are invariant under
all operations of a space group .  Each function in this sequence is a
star function associated with a single uncancelled star of a specified
space group \f$ S \f$. The following conventions are applied:

  - All star functions are normalized such that
    \f[
       \frac{1}{V}\int d^{3}r \;
      \phi^{*}_{i}({\bf r})\phi_{j}({\bf r}) = \delta_{ij}
    \f]
    where the integral is taken over one unit cell and \f$ V \f$ represents
    the generalized volume (3D volume, 2D area or 1D length) of one unit
    cell. This

  - Functions in this sequence are ordered and assigned indices in order of
    nondecreasing magnitude of associated eigenvalues of the negative Laplacian
    \f$ -\nabla^{2} \f$, as computed using the unit cell parameters that are
    known when the basis is constructed.

  - The first function \f$ \phi_{0}({\bf r}) \f$ is always the function
    associated with the star that contains the single wavevector
    \f$ {\bf G} = 0 \f$, which yields a function
    \f$ \phi_{0}({\bf r}) = 1 \f$ that is independent of \f$ {\bf r} \f$.

  - Each star function that is associated with a closed star has a
    prefactor chosen so as to give a real normalized star function.

  - Star functions associated with pairs of open stars that are inverses
    of one another are always listed consecutively and assigned consecutive
    indices.  The star functions associated with each such pair of stars,
    with indices \f$i \f$ and \f$ i + 1 \f$, are defined so as to be
    complex conjugates of one another, giving
    \f[
        \phi_{i+1}({\bf r}) = \phi^{*}_{i}({\bf r}) \quad.
    \f]

  - The coefficient the wave associated with a characteristic wavevector
    of each star is taken to be a positive real number. The characteristic
    wave of two stars that are related by inversion is chosen such that if
    \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is the characteristic wave of the first star in such
    a pair, then \f$ -{\bf G} \f$ is the characteristic wave of the second.
    This convention is sufficient to guarantee that the associated star
    functions will be complex conjugates.  A convention for choosing the
    characteristic wavevector for a closed star or the first star in a
    pair of open stars that are related by inversion is discussed below.

\anchor user_basis_waveofstar_defn
By convention, the characteristic wavevector for a closed star or the first
of two open stars that are related by inversion is taken to be the first
wavevector for which the indices are "greatest" when lists of integer
indices are compared by comparing indices while treating the first index as
more signficant than the second (if any) and the second as more significant
than the third. According to this rule, a list of integers \f$ (i,j,k) \f$
is "greater" than a list \f$ (l,m,n) \f$ if \f$ i >  l \f$, while
\f$( i, j, k )\f$ is greater than \f$ (i, m, n) \f$ if \f$ j >  m \f$,
etc. The characteristic wave associated with a star of 48 wavevectors in
a simple cubic lattice that are related to  (-2, 3, 1) by permutations and
sign changes is thus the wave with indices (3, 2, 1). When describing
wavevectors that are used in discrete Fourier transforms of functions that
are defined only on the nodes of a lattice, the indices of each wave are
taken for this purpose to be the indices of the minimum alias of each wave,
i.e., the image or alias the yields the smallest value for \f$|{\bf G}| \f$.

Any complex or real field \f$ w({\bf r}) \f$ that is invariant under
space group \f$ S \f$ can be expanded in such basis as a symmetry-adapted
Fourier series
\f[
   w({\bf r}) = \sum_{i=0}^{N_{\rm basis} -1 } c_{i} \phi_{i}({\bf r})
\f]
with complex coefficients \f$ c_{0}, c_{1}, \ldots, c_{N-1} \f$, where
\f$ N_{\rm basis} \f$ denotes the number of basis functions used to
approximate the function in a truncated expansion.

\section user_basis_real_sec Symmetry-Adapted Fourier Series: Real Functions

The concentration and chemical potential fields that appear in SCFT are
all real fields. An expansion of real fields can be constructed using
either of two equivalent methods: We may either expand in a basis of
star functions and place constraints on the complex coefficients in
order to guarantee that the resulting sum is real, or we may construct
a closely related expansion in terms of real basis functions with real
coefficients. Both methods, and the relationship between them, are
described below:

\subsection user_basis_real_star_sub Expansion in Star Functions

Consider the symmetry-adapted Fourier expansion of a real function using
a basis of star functions.  The following constraints must be satisfied
by the coefficients in the expansion in order to guarantee that the sum
is real:

   - The coefficient \f$ c_{i} \f$ of each real star function
     \f$ \phi_{i}({\bf r}_{i}) \f$ that is associated with a closed
     star must be taken to be a real number.

   - The coefficients \f$ c_{i} \f$ and \f$ c_{i+1} \f$ of any two star
     functions \f$ \phi_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ and \f$ \phi_{i+1}({\bf r}) \f$
     that are associated with open stars that are related by inversion
     must be complex conjugates of each other, giving
     \f[
         c_{i+1} = c_{i}^{*} \quad.
     \f]
     for each such pair.

PSCF defines a corresponding sequence of real coefficients
\f$ a_{0}, \ldots, a_{N-1} \f$ by defining:

   - The coefficient \f$ c_{i} \f$ of any star function that is
     associated with a closed star is set equal to a real coefficient
     \f[
         c_{i} = a_{i} \quad.
     \f]

   - For the coefficients \f$ c_{i} \f$ and \f$ c_{i+1} \f$ of two
     star functions that are associated with open stars that are
     related by inversion,
     \f[
         c_{i} = ( a_{i} - i a_{i+1} )/\sqrt{2}
     \f]
     and
     \f[
         c_{i+1} = ( a_{i} + i a_{i+1} )/\sqrt{2} \quad,
     \f]
     such that \f$ c_{i+1} = c_{i}^{*} \f$.

\subsection user_basis_real_real_sub Expansion in Real Basis Functions

The expansion of a real basis that is described above can also be described
as an expansion in a closely related sequence of real basis function. For
this purpose, we define real basis functions
\f$ f_{0}({\bf r}), f_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots \f$ that are related to the
star basis functions
\f$ \phi_{0}({\bf r}, \phi_{1}({\bf r}), \phi_{2}({\bf r}), \ldots \f$,
described above by the following rules:

   - For each real star function \f$ \phi_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ that is
     associated with a closed star, we define
     \f[
         f_{i}({\bf r}) = \phi_{i}({\bf r}) \quad.
     \f]

   - For each pair of star functions
     \f$ \phi_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ and
     \f$ \phi_{i+1}({\bf r}) = \phi_{i}^{*}({\bf r})\f$ that are
     associated with a pair of open stars that are related by
     inversion, we define two corresponding real functions:
     \f[
        f_{i}({\bf r})
        = [ \phi_{i}({\bf r}) + \phi^{*}_{i}({\bf r}) ]/\sqrt{2}
        \quad,
     \f]
     and
     \f[
        f_{i+1}({\bf r}) =
        [ \phi_{i}({\bf r}) - \phi^{*}_{i}({\bf r}) ]/(\sqrt{2} i)
        \quad.
     \f]

The resulting basis can be used to expand any real function with
the desired space group symmetry as an expansion
\f[
   w({\bf r}) = \sum_{i=0}^{N_{\rm basis}-1} a_{i} f_{i}({\bf r})
\f]
with real basis functions and real coefficients. The sequence of
real coefficients \f$ a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots \f$ is the same as that
defined above to obtain an expansion of a real function in terms
star functions. To show this that the overall prefactor of a star
function \f$ c_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ that is the first of a pair of
complex conjugate functions associated with open stars is a
coefficient \f$ c_{i} = (a_{i} - ia_{i+1})/\sqrt{2} \f$ and that
\f$ c_{i+1} = c_{i}^{*} \f$, as in the above expansion in a basis
of star functions.

\section user_basis_file_sec Basis Field File Format

We now consider the format of the data section of the basis field
file format that is used report coefficients that appear in
symmetry-adapted Fourier series representation of a set of fields
associated with different types of monomers.  Most aspects of this file 
format are discussed in a \ref user_field_basis_page "separate page" 
devoted to this subject.

The data section of such a field file contains a set of rows, each
of which contains a set of Fourier coefficients and information
about an associated star.  Suppose that the system of interest has
\f$ N_{\rm monomer} \f$ monomer types, and that each field is expanded
using a basis of \f$ N_{\rm basis} \f$ basis functions.

The first \f$ N_{\rm monomer} \f$ columns of the data section contain
lists of of Fourier coefficients.
The coefficient in column \f$ \alpha \f$ of row number \f$ i \f$ of the 
data section, for \f$ \alpha = 0, \ldots, N_{\rm monomer} - 1\f$ and 
\f$ i = 0, \ldots, N_{\rm basis} - 1 \f$, gives the value for the
coefficient \f$ a_{i} \f$ of basis function \f$ f_{i}({\bf r}) \f$
in the symmetry-adapted Fourier expansion of the field associated
with monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$.

The remaining columns of the data section contain information about 
wavevector stars. The \f$ D \f$ columns that immediately follow the 
Fourier coefficients (where \f$ D \f$ denotes the dimension of space) 
within row \f$ i \f$ contain the integer indices of the 
\ref user_basis_waveofstar_defn "characteristic wavevector" of star 
number \f$ i \f$.  The integer in the last column of row \f$ i \f$ 
is equal to the number of wavevectors in star \f$ i \f$.
