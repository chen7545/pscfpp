This page describes the commands accepted by the pscf_fd program. 
We begin by showing simple examples of complete command files.

\section user_command_fd_example_sec Example: SCFT Calculation

Here is a example of a command file for a single SCFT calculation 
performed with pscf_fd.  The example assumes the use of a convention
for locations of input and output files in which the initial guess 
for the w field is located in a subdirectory of the current working 
directory named "in", and in which all outputs are written to files 
in a subdirectory named "out".  
\code
READ_W        in/w
ITERATE       
WRITE_W       out/w
WRITE_C       out/c
WRITE_PARAM   out/data
WRITE_THERMO  out/data
FINISH
\endcode
The effect of each command in this example is described below:

  - The command "READ_W in/w" reads the file in/w, which contains an 
    initial guess for the chemical potential field, and save it to 
    memory.

  - The command ITERATE runs an iterative solver that attempts to solve 
    the self-consistent field equations, starting from the initial guess
    that was provided by the READ_W command.

  - "WRITE_W out/w" writes the resulting converged set of chemical
    potential fields to the file out/w. 

  - "WRITE_C out/c" writes the corresponding monomer volume fraction 
    fields to the file out/c.

  - "WRITE_PARAM out/data" writes the parameter file for this solution 
    to the file out/data, to provide a record of the input parameters.

  - "WRITE_THERMO out/data" appends information about thermodynamic 
    properties of of the converged solution to the end of file out/data.

  - FINISH instructs the main program to stop execution and return.

All pscf_fd that read or write field files use the same field file 
format, described \ref user_field_fd1d_page "here".  Every PSCF command 
file should end with a FINISH command.

\section user_command_fd_sweep_sec Example: A Sweep

Here is an example of a command file to perform a sweep. The SWEEP 
command can only be used if the parameter file that was read by pscf_fd 
before reading this command file contains an appropriate Sweep block.
\code
READ_W    in/w
SWEEP
FINISH
\endcode
The command "READ_W_BASIS in/w.bf" instructs the program to read an 
initial guess for the chemical potentials fields at the initial state 
of the sweep (the state s=0) from the file in/w.bf.  
The SWEEP command actually executes the sweep operation.

Note that this example command file for a sweep does not contain any of 
the explicit output commands that are shown as part of the example for 
a single SCFT calculation.  These output commands are unnecessary for
a sweep because information about the solution at each step in the 
sweep is instead automatically output as part of the implementation of 
the sweep operation. Adding output commands that output data after the 
SWEEP command would in any case only output information that describes 
the solution for the final state point of the sweep, for which s=1.

Individual commands and related groups of commands are discuss below in 
greater detail:

\section user_command_fd_input_sec Field Input 

The first command in a command file is usually a READ_W command, which 
takes the name of an input file as an argument. This command reads an 
initial guess for the chemical potential fields ("w fields") from the 
specified file and assigns the current values for these fields equal 
to the values read from this file. 

\section user_command_fd_computation_sec Computation 

The COMPUTE, ITERATE and SWEEP commands each perform a computation that 
requires an initial guess for the w fields as an input. Each of these 
commands must thus be preceded by a READ_W command that initializes the 
w fields.

The COMPUTE command performs a computation of the single molecule 
partition functions and monomer concentrations for a system of 
non-interacting molecules subjected to the current w-fields.  This 
requires a solution of the modified diffusion equations for both
directions for all blocks of each polymeric species and a simpler 
calculation of concentrations for each solvent species.  The COMPUTE 
command does not modify the w fields, but does modify the volume fraction 
fields (c fields) associated with polymer blocks, solvent species and 
monomer types. The resulting c fields generally do not satisfy the 
self-consistenct field conditions.

The ITERATE command attempts to obtain a solution to the self-consistent 
field equations for a fixed set of parameters by iteratively adjusting 
the w fields.  The choice of iteration algorithm is specified by the 
Iterator block of the parameter file. Each iteration usually requires at 
least one calculation similar to that performed once by the COMPUTE 
command. 

THE SWEEP command attempts to solve the SCFT equations at a sequence of 
points along a path through the space of possible choices of input 
parameters. This command can only be invoked if the parameter file 
contains a SWEEP block, which defines the desired sequence of state 
points.

\section user_command_fd_dataout_sec Data Output 

The WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO commands can be used to create a record 
of the input parameters and computed thermodynamic properties associated 
with a single SCFT calculation. 

\anchor user_command_fd_param_sub 
The WRITE_PARAM writes a slightly modified copy of the parameter 
file to a file whose name that is specified as a command parameter. 
The version of the parameter file written by this command outputs
the current values for all parameters, and excludes any Sweep block.

\anchor user_command_fd_thermo_sub 
The WRITE_THERMO command outputs a report of values for thermodynamic 
properties obtained after solution of a SCFT problem. The resulting 
report includes values for the 
\ref user_model_helmholtz_sub "Helmholtz free energy per monomer"
\f$ \tilde{f} \f$ , denoted by "fHelmholtz" in the output file, 
the \ref user_model_pressure_sub "nondimensionalized pressure" 
\f$ \tilde{p} \f$, denoted by "pressure", the chemical potential and 
volume fraction of each polymer and solvent molecular species, denoted 
by "mu" and "phi", and the current values of the unit cell parameters. 
All free energies, pressure and chemical potential values are output 
using thermal energy units, in which \f$ k_{B}T = 1 \f$.

If the file whose name is passed to the WRITE_THERMO command already 
exists, the report of thermodynamic properties will be appended to 
the end of this file, rather than overwriting the file.
This is designed to allow users to output a parameter file block 
that contains the input parameters followed by a report of computed 
thermodynamic properties in a single file, if desired, by invoking 
WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO with the same file name parameter.
 
\section user_command_fd_fieldout_sec Field Output 

The following commands can be used to output information about chemical
potential and concentration fields after solving a SCFT problem.

   - **WRITE_W** : Writes the current chemical potential fields 
     (w fields) for all monomer types to an output file whose name
     is specified as a command parameter.

   - **WRITE_C** : Writes the current volume fraction / concentration
     fields for all monomer types to a specified output file. 

   - **WRITE_C_BLOCK** : Writes the current volume fraction / concentration
     fields for all polymer blocks and monomer species to a single file,
     with the field associated with each block or solvent species written
     in a different column. 

\anchor user_command_fd_writecblock_sub 
The information provided by the WRTIE_C_BLOCK command is different 
than and more detailed than that provided by the WRITE_C command when
applied to systems in which the same monomer type id is assigned to 
two or more blocks (on the same or different polymers) and/or solvent 
species.  The file output by this command contains a header section 
identical to that contained in any pscf_fd field file, followed by a 
data section.  The format of the data section file is analogous to that 
of pscf_fd field file that contains one field per monomer type, except 
that each polymer block and solvent species is treated as a separate 
monomer type, and thus output in a separate column of the data section.  

Columns associated with blocks and species are output by the WRITE_C_BLOCK 
command are listed from left to right in the same order that they appear 
in the parameter file: Columns associated with polymer blocks are listed 
first (i.e., to the left), followed by columns associated with solvent 
species.  Columns associated with blocks of the same polymer appear 
sequentially in order of increasing block id, while groups of columns 
associated with different polymer species appear in order of increasing 
polymer id.  Columns associated with solvent species appear after polymer 
blocks, listed left to right in order of increasing polymer id. 

\section user_command_fd_mesh_sec Mesh Manipulation

The REMESH_W and EXTEND_W can be used to change the mesh used to 
define a problem, by changing resolution or extending the domain.

The REMESH_W command allows a user to change the discretization 
of the existing domain by writing a file that contains the current 
w fields interpolated onto a mesh with a modified number of grid 
points. The command takes the number nx of grid points of the new
mesh and the name of the output file as parameters.

The EXTEND_W command allows a user to extend the domain of the
solution by adding new points with field values that are simply 
copies of the values of w fields at the last grid point. The 
command takes the number m of added grid points and the name of
the output file as parameters. 

\section user_command_fd_comparison_sec Compare to Homogeneous Reference 

The COMPARE_HOMOGENEOUS command computes differences between properties 
of an inhomogeneous system of interest, as predicted by SCFT, and those 
of an homogeneous reference system. The command takes an integer mode 
parameter with allowed values 0, 1, and 2 that determines the nature of 
the homogeneous system used for this comparison.  In mode 0 (i.e., when 
mode == 0), the inhomogeneous system is compared to a homogeneous system 
with a composition equal to the spatial average composition of the system 
of interest. In modes 1 and 2, the comparison is made to a homogeneous 
system in which chemical potentials for all species are equal to those 
of the system of interest.  

Further details of the operation of this command are described in a 
separate page \subpage user_command_fd_homo_page "here". These details
include a description of the difference between modes 1 and 2 and a
discussion of the format of the resulting report.
