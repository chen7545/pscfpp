PSCF is compiled using a system of unix makefiles.  This page gives an
overview of the build process, i.e., the process of compiling the PSCF
source code and creating executable files. The discussion given here
and in subsequent pages assumes familiarity with discussion of the
PSCF directory structure given in a
\ref developer_directory_page "previous page" .

Compilation and installation of PSCF involves the following operations:

  - Compiling all compilable source files in the src directory

  - Creating a static library file in each namespace-level subdirectory
    of the src directory

  - Creating the executable files (pscf_1d, pscf_pc, and optionally
    pscf_pg) and installing them in the bin directory by default

Various types of file involved in this process are described below.

<b> Source file compilation </b>

All files in the PSCF repository that contain C++ or CUDA C++ code are
located in the src directory tree.  Files with file name suffix \*.cpp
or \*.cu are compiled by the build system, and are referred to here as
either compilable source files or simply source files.  When each such
source file is compiled, the build system creates two associated files
that we refer to as an object file and a dependency file:

  - An object file is a file with file name suffix .o that contains
    the object code created by compiling the associated source file.

  - A dependency file is a makefile fragment with file name suffix .d
    that contains a lists of all the the prerequisites of the associated
    object file.

The object and dependency file that are created by compiling a source
file have the same base file name as the associated source file, with
different file name suffixs.

Each dependency file contains a list of paths to files that are
"prerequisites" of the corresponding object file. This list includes the
associated source file and all other C++ files (header files) that are
directly or indirectly included into the source file via C/C++ preprocessor
"include" directives. This list of prerequisites is used by the PSCF
build system to keep track of when an existing object file has become
out-of-date due to modifications of one or more of its prerequisite
files.

<b> Namespace-level library files </b>

The PSCF build system also creates a static library with file name
suffix .a in each namespace-level subdirectory of the src directory.
Each such library contains all of the object code that is created by
compiling the source files in the corresponding namespace-level
directory. The name of each library file is given by a prefix "lib",
followed by the base name of the associated namespace-level directory,
followed by a suffix ".a". For example, the file "librpc.a" is a library
file located in the src/rpc directory that contains the contents of all
of the object files that are created by compiling source files in the
src/rpc namespace-level directory.

<b> Intermediate files and build directories (bld or src) </b>

The object (\*.o), dependency (\*.d), and library (\*.a) files that
are created during the build process are referred to collectively as
"intermediate" files.  The directory in which all such intermediate
files are placed is referred to as the build directory.

The PSCF makefile system is designed to allow a user to perform either
an "out-of-source" build or an "in-source" build. An "out-of-source"
build places all of these intermediate files in a build directory that
is distinct from the src directory.  By default, PSCF uses the bld
subdirectory of the PSCF root directory as the build directory for
out-of-source builds.  In an "in-source" build, these intermediate
files are instead placed within the src directory.

During an in-source build, the PSCF build system places the \*.o object
file and the \*.d dependency file that are created by compiling each
source file in the same subdirectory of src as the associated source
(\*.cpp or \*.cu) file. During an out-of-source build, these two files
are instead placed in an analogous subdirectory of the bld directory
tree. To make this possible, the bld directory is required to have an
internal directory structure analogous to that of the src directory.

The library file that contains object code created by compiling all
the source files in a namespace level directory of the src directory is
placed in the root of the corresponding namespace level directory of
the chosen build directory. The file librpc.a is thus placed in the
directory bld/rpc during an out-of-source build or in directory src/rpc
during an in-source build.

<b> Main program files and executable files </b>

The three program-level subdirectories of the src directory (named r1d,
rpc, and rpg) each have a source file that contains the main program
function for one of the three PSCF programs (i.e., the C function named
"main"). The base name of this main program file is the same as the name
of the executable file that is created from it. For example, the main
program source file in directory src/rpc is named pscf_pc.cpp, and
this is used to create the executable file named pscf_pc.

When the code in one of the three program-level directories of the build
directory is compiled, the build system:

   - compiles all the source files in the program-level directory
     other than the main program file

   - creates a static library containing the resulting object files

   - compiles the main program file, and links the resulting object
     file to all relevant library files to create an executable file

By default, the resulting executable file is created in the PSCF bin
directory.

In each program-level subdirectory of src, the makefile rule that
creates the executable file links to library files located in other
namespace-level directories on which the relevant program-level depends.
Thus, for example, the rule to create the pscf_pc executable (which
is defined in the file src/rpc/makefile) links the object file
src/rpc/pscf_pc.o that is created by compiling the main program file
src/rpc/pscf_pc.cpp is linked to library files src/util/libutil.a,
src/pscf/libpscf.a, src/prdc/libprdc.a, and src/rpc/librpc.a. Each
of these library files is also listed as a prerequisite to the rule
that creates the executable file, which force the build system to
create or recreate any non-existent or out-of-date libraries as
needed before attempting to create an executable.
