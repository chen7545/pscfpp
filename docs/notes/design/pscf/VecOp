Goals: 

  - Allow some VecOp and Reduce operations to be used as templates
    in Rpc and Rpg without needing to explicitly refer to different
    functions.

  - Turn source code for some VecOp and Reduce operations on CPU into
    templates.

VecOp:

  - Merge Prdc::Cpu::VecOp and Prdc::Cuda::VecOp into Pscf::VecOp

  - Put all CPU code in src/rpc/math and GPU code src/rpc/cuda, but
    all in the same namespace, Pscf::VecOp.

  - Create templates for CPU code operations for Array<ElemT> in which 
    double is replaced by an element type ElemT.  Use standard +,-,*,/ 
    operations. This will allow application of templates to real and 
    std::complex<ElemT> for some operations.

  - Create explicit instantiation declarations and definitions for
    ElemT == double.

Reduce:

  - Merge Prdc::Cpu::Reduce and Prdc::Cuda::Reduce into Pscf::Reduce

  - Put all CPU code in src/rpc/math and GPU code src/rpc/cuda, but all 
    in the same namespace, Pscf::Reduce.

  - Create templates for CPU code operations for Array<ElemT> in which 
    double is replaced by an element type ElemT.  Use standard +,-,*,/ 
    operations. This will allow extension to std::complex<ElemT> for 
    some operations.

  - Create templates for GPU as well? This would allow use of 
    std::complex<RealType> for some operations.
