= PSCF (C++/Cuda) History  =
============================

This file documents changes to the C++/Cuda version of PSCF. Source code for
this project is in the dmorse/pscfpp github repository.

The following labels are used below to indicate which programs or sets of
programs are affected by specific changes:

   pc - Pseudo-spectral CPU code for periodic structures
   pg - Pseudo-spectral GPU code for periodic structures
   fd - Finite element code for one-dimension (1D) problems
   all  - all programs (fd, pc, and pg)
