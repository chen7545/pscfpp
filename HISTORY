= Pscf++ History  =
===================

The following namespace names are used below to indicate which corresponding program 
or sets of programs are affected by specific changes.

   Pspc - CPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Pspg - GPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Fd1d - Finite element code for one-dimension (1D) problems


Progress towards Pscf++ v0.9
============================

User-visible changes
--------------------
- Implemented all crystal systems (triclinic, etc) (Pspc, Pspg)

Documentation
--------------

- Improved documentation of parameter file formats (all programs)


Pscf++ v0.8.1
==============

- Fixed an error in manual instructions for modifying PYTHONPATH 
  environment variable (github issue #64)


Pscf++ v0.8.0
==============

Released March 11, 2022

User-visible features
---------------------
