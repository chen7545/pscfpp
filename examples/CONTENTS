Different subdirectories of this examples/ directory contain examples of 
calculations that use different PSCF programs:

  Directory    Program     Description
  ---------    --------    -------------
  r1d/         pscf_r1d    one-dimensional (CPU)
  rpc/         pscf_rpc    periodic  (CPU)
  rpg/         pscf_rpg    periodic  (GPU)

The top level subdirectories of rpc/ and rpg/ each contain examples 
of self-consistent field (scf/) or field theoretic simulation (fts/) 
calculations. Top level subdirectories for r1d/ contain scft 
simulations for different types of system. 

Most example directories contain an executable file named "run" that 
can be used to run the example, by invoking "./run".
