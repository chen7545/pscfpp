Different subdirectories of this examples/ directory contain examples of 
calculations that use different PSCF programs:

  Directory    Program     Description
  ---------    --------    -------------
   1d/         pscf_1d     one-dimensional (CPU)
   pc/         pscf_pc     periodic  (CPU)
   pg/         pscf_pg     periodic  (GPU)

The top level subdirectories of pc/ and pg/ each contain examples of 
self-consistent field (scf/) or field theoretic simulation (fts/) 
calculations. Top level subdirectories for 1d/ contain scft simulations
for different types of system. 

Most example directories contain an executable file named "run" that 
can be used to run the example, by invoking "./run".
